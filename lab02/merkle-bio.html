    <h1>Wyatt Merkle's Biography</h1>

    <p> 
        Hey, my name is <strong>Wyatt Merkle</strong>. I am currently an Information Management and Technology major at Syracuse. I've always been entranced by computers and found myself learning the ins and outs of them from such a young age. That’s why this major fits me so well, I love working with servers and creating web pages. 
        From my life I’ve acquired quite a few skills just to list some; Python (Programming Language) • Social • Adaptive • Leadership • Creative Problem Solving.

    <h2>Personal Info</h2>
    <p>
        Although I love technology, I found my own values in socializing without consistently being glued to technology.
        My friends I have gained throughout all my life mean the world to me and I always find myself being open to new individuals and treating every single experience in life as a way to grow who I am because everyone has such a great story to tell. In the future I wish to continue growing from every experience and opportunity I get and inspiring the people who surround me and work together to make the world a better place. Being so open to everything and so willing to grow lets me learn things at an insane pace and I'm never the same person who I am at the end of the night that I was that morning.
